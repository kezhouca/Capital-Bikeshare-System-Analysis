The goal of our visualization is to deliver data-based insights from our analysis. We were able to transform and combine our analysis results from scalable dataset into visual and interactive graphics and maps, which allowed for easy understanding of complex relationships within the data and going deep into detailed evaluation for the shared bike system. 
Tableau was highly involved in our visulizations and final deliverables. 
We published our interactive visualization web online with 7 tabs and could be accessed from the link below.
